# Perl, PHP, or Python.  This program doesn't use any C build tools,
# but if yours does, it might include definitions of variables that
# Make uses to call a C compiler.

# Rule to create or update the distribution zipfile by adding all
# files listed in zip.in.  Actually the zipfile depends on every
# single file in zip.in, but currently we use changes to the compiled
# program, makefile, and README as a heuristic for when something was
# changed.  It won't see changes to docs or tools, but usually when
# docs changes, README also changes, and when tools changes, the
# makefile changes.
