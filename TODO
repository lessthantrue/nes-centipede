\ : Complete
* : Not Yet
x : Will not / can not do

REFACTORING:
  \ make a preserve/restore all registers macro
  \ move common macros (add_multiple, preserve/restore_registers, etc) to common file
  x move common procedures (are there any?) to common file (there were none)
  \ compress centipede::dir and centipede::lastDir to one byte
  x move everything to individual modules (.inc files as interfaces instead)
  \ split move_centipede and collide_centipede?
  \ transpose centipede data structure (list of struct -> struct of list)
  \ for centipede map, temp store segment in a ZP variable, then write back after function
    \ undo this, just use the Y register, make the segment arrays public
  \ start using oam_used for sprite memory management
  \ increase player speed (requires changing location representation)
  \ draw centipede head on next segment not alive, rather than a flag
  \ split centipede file somehow (centipede / segment?)
  \ start passing function parameters on the stack to save static memory

DEVELOPMENT:
  \ move and properly draw multiple centipede segments
  \ create proper centipede sprites
    \ head drawn differently from body
    \ directions drawn differently
      \ Left/Right
      \ Down
  \ add centipede <-> arrow collision
    \ kill centipede segment that was hit
  \ create mushrooms on centipede death
  \ add mushroom <-> arrow collision
  \ reduce(?) mushrooms on hit
  * add centipede <-> player collision
  \ create proper sprite for arrow
  \ compress player to 1 sprite
  \ create proper sprite for player
  \ Fix all the color palettes
  \ animate centipede
    \ animate centipede better
  \ keep track of score, lives, etc and display on a status bar
    \ score
    \ lives
    * new lives after 10,000 points
  * make centipede kill player
  * level advancement
  * make centipede move diagonally, not just down on collision
  * sound
  * other enemies (snake, spider, bee, grasshopper)
  * player collision with mushrooms

PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
  \ Update README
    \ Document change in graphics tools
  \ Remove old python tools for graphics
  \ Put on Github
  \ Double check and delete bg.s
  * set up releases with built .NES file
  \ online demo with JSNES

BUGS:
  \ weird things sometimes happen when drawing new mushroom background objects
      Draws extra mushrooms one spot to the right of where they should be
      Does not occur on online demo?
  \ bg flickers on PPU nametable update (?)
    Flickering only occurs when also drawing the centipede...?
  \ previous segment head flag not always set on next segment death
    see "fix centipede splitting up unnecessarily"
  \ player can wrap around the screen to the left
  * fix centipede splitting up unnecessarily when a middle segment is hit
    Must wait until diagonal movement
  * demo screen bounds don't match FCEUX bounds
  * head is 100 points, other segments are only 10
