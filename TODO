x : will not do

REFACTORING:
 \ make a preserve/restore all registers macro
 \ move common macros (add_multiple, preserve/restore_registers, etc) to common file
 x move common procedures (are there any?) to common file (there were none)
 * compress centipede::dir and centipede::lastDir to one byte
 x move everything to individual modules (.inc files as interfaces instead)
 \ split move_centipede and collide_centipede?
 \ transpose centipede data structure (list of struct -> struct of list)
 \ for centipede map, temp store segment in a ZP variable, then write back after function
 * start using oam_used for sprite memory management

DEVELOPMENT:
 \ move and properly draw multiple centipede segments
 * create proper centipede sprites
   * head drawn differently from body
   * directions drawn differently
     * Left/Right
     * Down
 \ add centipede <-> arrow collision
   \ kill centipede segment that was hit
   * set previous segment to head
 * create mushrooms on centipede death
 \ add mushroom <-> arrow collision
 \ reduce(?) mushrooms on hit
 * add centipede <-> player collision
 * create proper sprite for arrow
 * compress player to 1 sprite
 * create proper sprite for player
 * Fix all the color palettes
 * animate centipede

PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
 \ Update README
   \ Document change in graphics tools
 \ Remove old python tools for graphics
 \ Put on Github
 \ Double check and delete bg.s
 * set up releases with built .NES file
 * online demo with JSNES

BUGS:
  * weird things sometimes happen when hitting mushrooms
